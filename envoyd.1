.SH NAME
envoyd \- process manager for envoy
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBenvoyd\fP [options] [files]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBenvoyd\fP is a process manager for ssh-agent and gpg-agent. It, on
demand, starts an agent on the behalf of the connecting user and manages
its lifetime, caching the agents environmental variables in memory.

envoyd can service multiple users at once. On an incoming connection it
checks the uid and gid of the incoming connection and forks off an agent
as that user.

This allows for the started agent to be long-running and continue to run
even after the user has logged out, but isolated it in its own cgroup.
